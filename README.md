# Transformer generative model to generate pile load-deformation of the pile in Bangkok Sub Soil

This generative model can be used to generate the load-deformation curve of a large bored pile in Bangkok Sub Soil. The inputs are soil profile, length and size of pile.

The model has been trained with 58 static pile load tests with large bored piles in the Bangkok area. 

The more pile load test data are welcome to improve my model.

## Deployment

To deploy this project run


-The program can be run from notebook prediction.ipynb.

-The example of input data is in data_pile.xlsx. You can change to use another soil profile and pile features.


## Installation

To install the model, go to the directory where you want to install it and run the following command:
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Sompote/transformer_pile
```

Alternatively, you can copy all the files to the desired directory manually.
